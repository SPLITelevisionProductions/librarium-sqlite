# Librarium (SQLite)

A web-application for managing your Book, DVD, CD, Game and/or Magazine collection (or whatever you choose to collect, really)

This is a preview version of Librarium, being developed to use SQLite to store the user's collection and cover art, with a separate database for each user, whilst still using MySQL to handle the management of the users themselves.

This preview will be located at https://librarium.lga.nz/

Eventually, this will replace the main website once it is feature-par. In the meantime, only bug fixes will be made to the main website.

Improvements being looked into so far are:

- A new login system
- Improved item management
- Improved cover art storage
- Improved overall design
- Improved fluidity on mobile

This will be developed mostly from scratch - meaning it will take time for it to get on par with the existing website.
